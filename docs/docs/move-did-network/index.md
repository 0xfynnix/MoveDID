  The `Airdropper` is an Aptos-based airdrop tool—it can perform Coins airdrops for the Aptos address list.

  It is also an extension based on MoveDID——MoveDID binds addresses in various formats such as Aptos and Ethereum to Github Account, so that Airdropper can perform airdrops based on the list of Github accounts, or it can target all the accounts under a certain Repo or Organization.
